### BinHist

Binance historical API is much less straightfoward as compared to their live MD/OE API.
This project bridges that gap by creating a web server that can serve historical data in a similar MD format and through simple REST API.

### Notice

This project is for educational purposes.
This project is simply a layer in front of Binance's API to ease development, and alone does not provide you with the API keys nor access to Binance's historical data. You still need to apply for your own keys with Binance.
